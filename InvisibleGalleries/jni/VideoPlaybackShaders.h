@brief
    Defines OpenGL shaders as char* strings.
    These are used to render the video frames from the SurfaceTexture

 * IMPORTANT:
 *
 * The SurfaceTexture functionality from ICS provides the video
 * frames from the movie in an unconventional format. So we cant
 * use Texture2D but we need to use the ExternalOES extension.
 *
 * Two things that are important in the shader below. The first is
 * the extension declaration (first line). The second is the type
 * of the texSamplerOES uniform.
